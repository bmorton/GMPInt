An Objective-C wrapper for the GMP library at http://gmplib.org/.

This wrapper will allow you to use basic functionality of the GMP
C library in Objective-C.  Look at the header file for the methods
available.

Here's an example of how to use this:

GMPInt *myInteger = [[GMPInt alloc] initWithUnsignedLong:2];
[myInteger isPrime]; // should return true
[myInteger nextPrime]; // will set value to 3

// Perform 3^1000000
[myInteger powerWithUnsignedLong:1000000];

// Multiply a GMPInt with another
GMPInt *secondInteger = [[GMPInt alloc] initWithUnsignedLong:10];
[secondInteger powerWithUnsignedLong:100000];
// myInteger = myInteger * secondInteger
[myInteger multiplyWithGMP:secondInteger];

// Generate string from integer
NSString *myString = [myInteger stringValue];


To use this with Xcode 4:

1.	Install brew if you don't already have it:
	https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew
	
2.	Run "sudo brew install gmp"

3.	Add these files to your Xcode project.

4.	In Xcode, click on your project file and goto your target.

5.	Goto the "Build Phases" tab and click "+" under "Link Binary with
	Libraries."

6.	Add libgmp.dylib.  If you don't see it, navigate to /usr/local and
	dig around to find it.  Mine is in /usr/local/Cellar/gmp/5.0.1/lib
	and is symlinked in /usr/local/lib.
